### $Least\,Integer\,Axiom$

There is a smallest integer in every nonempty subset
$C$ of the natural numbers $N$

### Theorem 1.2

Every integer $n \ge 2$ is either a prime or a product of primes.

>proof: Were this not so, there would be "criminals:" there are integers $n \ge 2$ which are neither primes nor products of primes; a least criminal $m$ is the smallest such integer. Since $m$ is not a prime, it is composite; there is thus a factorization $m = ab$ with $2 \le a \lt m$ and $2 \le b \lt m$ (since $a$ is an integer, $1 \lt a$ implies $2 \le a$). Since $m$ is the least criminal, both $a$ and $b$ are "honest," i.e.,
$a = pp^{'} p^{''} \dots$ and $b = qq^{'} q^{''} \dots$
